# E5111 term paper 
This repository contains the Python script of a numerical simulation and visualisation of a learning trap from [Liang and Mu (2020 QJE)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/135/1/389/5584350) as part of my term paper for E5111 Economics of Science and Ideas (MSc Econ, U Mannheim).

I consider the example from section II.A of the paper and further assume $\sigma_\omega^2 = 1$,
$\sigma_b^2 = 12$ and $\sigma_{\omega b} = 0$.
